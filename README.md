Kevin Carter Data Science 11/10/2024 Data Analysis using DBSCAN


HW 7
By completing this assignment, I was able to learn how to use Kaggle and used DBSCAN and data cleaning to examine the data that was provided to me. In order to determine the correlations that exist between the various data points, I displayed the data on histograms. Additionally, I created a box and whiskers plot of the distribution in order to identify characteristics that are associated with each cluster. I did have trouble with the final task.
