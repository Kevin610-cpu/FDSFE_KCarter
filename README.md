HW 5 
This project allowed me to create subtitles for exercises that Professor Bianco had already finished. Working on the logistic regression portion of the model allowed me to complete tasks like initializing and fitting the model. I finished the task by completing the exercises needed to evaluate the model. I became more knowledgeable about and comprehended the confusion matrix. For this homework, I worked on my own.
